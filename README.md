# Blockchain-based-COVID-Vaccine-Delivery-using-Smart-Contracts
A blockchain is a growing list of records called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a timestamp, transaction data, cryptographic hash of the previous block, which makes it immutable. A Smart contract is a computer program which is automatically executed according to an agreement. In Traditional vaccine delivery systems, vaccine delivery information is not visible to all the entities in the supply chain, Thereby are prone to data tampering. Therefore, transparency is the biggest concern in this systems. This project is a blockchain based transparent vaccine delivery system using smart contracts which stores the data on the Blockchain Network and simplifies the Vaccine Data updating process using  Smart Contracts.
